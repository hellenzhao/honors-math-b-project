This is an expository paper in complex analysis that I wrote for my honors math class (a two semester sequence that covers linear algebra and multivariable calculus from a rigorous, proof-based point of view).


Each project is meant to explore, in around 15 pages, a new topic that builds on the material covered in class. My paper specifically provides an introduction to complex analysis, then proves Cauchy's Integral Theorem and Formula, and finally shows that complex differentiable functions can be expressed as a power series.
